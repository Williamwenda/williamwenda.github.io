## Short Bio

Hello, welcome to my homepage! 

I am Wenda Zhao, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Learning System and Robotics Lab][dsl] at the [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS)][utias] and [Technische Universität München (TUM)][tum] under Professor [Angela P. Schoellig][Angela_link]. I am also a Postgraduate Affiliated researcher at the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute][RI] and [Vector Institute][VI] (Toronto, ON, Canada) and [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)][mirmi] (Munich, Bavaria, Germany). Before coming to Toronto, I earned a MASc degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) from [Tongji University][tju] in Shanghai, China in 2018. In the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to attend the exchange program at [RWTH Aachen University][rwth], Germany. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of state estimation and machine learning for mobile robotics. Meanwhile, I enjoy robotics hardware and software co-design. I am fascinated by the ability of robots to sense and interact with the physical world, which reminds us of the beauty and wonder that exist in nature.

## Current Research
